 # üìñ Background #
 When search engines like Google display search results, they do so by placing more ‚Äúimportant‚Äù and higher-quality pages higher in the search results than less important pages. But how does the search engine know which pages are more important than other pages?

The PageRank algorithm was created by Google‚Äôs co-founders (including Larry Page, for whom the algorithm was named). In PageRank‚Äôs algorithm, a website is more important if it is linked to by other important websites, and links from less important websites have their links weighted less. This definition seems a bit circular, but it turns out that there are multiple strategies for calculating these rankings.

# üî∏ Understanding #
Open up `pagerank.py`. Notice first the definition of two constants at the top of the file: `DAMPING` represents the damping factor and is initially set to `0.85`. `SAMPLES` represents the number of samples we‚Äôll use to estimate PageRank using the sampling method, initially set to 10,000 samples.

Now, take a look at the `main` function. It expects a command-line argument, which will be the name of a directory of a corpus of web pages we‚Äôd like to compute PageRanks for. The `crawl` function takes that directory, parses all of the HTML files in the directory, and returns a dictionary representing the corpus. The keys in that dictionary represent pages (e.g., `"2.html"`), and the values of the dictionary are a set of all of the pages linked to by the key (e.g. `{"1.html", "3.html"}`).

The `main` function then calls the `sample_pagerank` function, whose purpose is to estimate the PageRank of each page by sampling. The function takes as arguments the corpus of pages generated by `crawl`, as well as the damping factor and number of samples to use. Ultimately, `sample_pagerank` should return a dictionary where the keys are each page name and the values are each page‚Äôs estimated PageRank (a number between 0 and 1).

The `main` function also calls the `iterate_pagerank` function, which will also calculate PageRank for each page, but using the iterative formula method instead of by sampling. The return value is expected to be in the same format, and we would hope that the output of these two functions should be similar when given the same corpus!
